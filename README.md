# LocaLert AI: Your Intelligent Commute Assistant

**LocaLert AI** is a smart web application designed to ensure you never miss your bus, train, or ride-share stop again. By leveraging your device's GPS and the power of the Google Gemini API, it provides intelligent destination selection, real-time location tracking, and timely proximity alerts.

Set your destination by name, by describing it in natural language, or by simply picking a point on the map. LocaLert will monitor your journey and sound a loud alarm when you're getting close, giving you peace of mind during your commute.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time GPS Tracking:** Utilizes the browser's high-accuracy Geolocation API to monitor your position.
- **Customizable Proximity Alerts:** Set an alert distance (from 100m to 3km) and receive a loud audio alarm and vibration when you enter the radius.
- **AI-Powered Destination Search:**
    - **Search by Name:** Find locations with intelligent, location-aware autocomplete suggestions powered by the Gemini API.
    - **Describe a Place:** Use natural language to find your destination (e.g., "the big red coffee shop next to the city library").

    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîí API Key Security (IMPORTANT for Deployment)

The Google Maps API key used in this project is visible in the client-side code. To prevent unauthorized use and protect against unexpected charges, you **MUST** restrict your API key before deploying your application to a public URL.

Follow these steps in the Google Cloud Console:

1.  **Navigate to Credentials:** Go to the [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page in your Google Cloud project.
2.  **Select Your API Key:** Click on the name of the API key you are using for this project.
3.  **Set Application Restrictions:**
    *   Under "Application restrictions," select **HTTP referrers (web sites)**.
    *   Click "Add a referrer" and enter your application's domain (e.g., `your-app-domain.com/*`). If you're testing on a specific subdomain, you can be more specific.
4.  **Set API Restrictions:**
    *   Under "API restrictions," select **Restrict key**.
    *   In the dropdown, select only the APIs required for this app:
        *   **Generative Language API** (for Gemini)
        *   **Maps JavaScript API**
        *   **Places API**
5.  **Save your changes.**

By applying these restrictions, your API key will only work on your specified website and only for the selected APIs, significantly enhancing its security.
